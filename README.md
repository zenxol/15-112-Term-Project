Project Title: Highway Havoc

Creator: Aiden Nguyen

Game Description:

Highway Havoc is a 2D scrolling car racing game designed to test user reflexes, strategy, and decision making to set high scores. The gameplay involves navigating a three-lane road, avoiding dynamic obstacles and collecting coins that serve as in-game currency. Players progress through increasingly difficult and quicker stages, as obstacles appear more frequently. There are warning signs that provide alerts about incoming dangers. 

The game features difficulty modes – Easy, Medium, and Hard – offering challenges that reward higher scores. Coins can be used to purchase new vehicles. A leaderboard allows players to compete for the top spot, adding another layer of challenges. There is also an interactive start and help screen, assisting the player with the basic controls and fundamentals of the game. Finally, the automatic speed control creates a seamless experience where players can focus solely on lane-changing and obstacle navigation.
